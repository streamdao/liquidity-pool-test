## Stream Liquidity Pool Frontend Starter

A community can pool its yield-generating assets via an StreamDAO to help fund its operations. As these derivatives are Stream tokens, the community has a very simple cap table they can use to ensure that its members are staking a minimum amount.

## Getting Started

Use this code as a starter for StreamDAO project's frontend code.

```
$ npm install
$ npm start
```
